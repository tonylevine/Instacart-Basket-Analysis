# Instacart-Basket-Analysis

## Project Overview

Python-based exploratory data analysis of open-source Instacart data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

## Key Questions

* When are the best days of the week and hours of the day to schedule ads?
* When do customers spend the most money?
* What are the best-selling products?
* What differences exist in the ordering habits of different customer profiles?

## Data
The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 is an anonymized dataset containing a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, the dataset records between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. It also provides the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.

This analysis also includes fictional data on customers for demonstration purposes.
